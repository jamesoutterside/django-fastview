## django_fastview

JavaScript resources for Django Fastview.

* Project site: http://radiac.net/projects/django-fastview/
* Source code: https://github.com/radiac/django-fastview

The version of Django Fastview available on PyPI includes these resources pre-bundled and ready to use.

This repository is for those who want to customise the JavaScript by subclassing, or who want to include it in their own bundle or build process.

Both PyPI and npm releases follow semantic versioning of `major.minor.patch`; the `major.minor` versions will be released in sync, use the latest `patch` version available.

See the main project documentation for further information.
